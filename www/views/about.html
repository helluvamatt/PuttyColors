			<p>An exercise in a strictly client-side single-page application, using AngularJS. This application does not depend on any backend service and can be hosted on any static provider that supports HTML5 pushState. Actually, any static web host can be used by disabling the HTML5 routing mode in Angular and using hashbang URLS ("#!").</p>
